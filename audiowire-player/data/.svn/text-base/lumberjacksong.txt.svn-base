Leaping from tree to tree!  As they float down the mighty rivers
of British Columbia!  With my best girl by my side!
The Larch!
The Pine!
The Giant Redwood tree!
The Sequoia!
The Little Whopping Rule Tree!
We'd sing!  Sing!  Sing!

Oh, I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay,
I sleep all night and I work all day.

CHORUS:  He's a lumberjack, and he's okay,
         He sleeps all night and he works all day.

I cut down trees, I eat my lunch,
I go to the lavatree.
On Wednesdays I go shoppin'
And have buttered scones for tea.

Mounties: He cuts down trees, he eats his lunch,
          He goes to the lavatree.
          On Wednesdays he goes shoppin'
          And has buttered scones for tea.

CHORUS

I cut down trees, I skip and jump,
I like to press wild flowers.
I put on women's clothing,
And hang around in bars.

Mounties: He cuts down trees, he skips and jumps,
          He likes to press wild flowers.
          He puts on women's clothing
          And hangs around.... In bars???????

CHORUS

I chop down trees, I wear high heels,
Suspenders and a bra.
I wish I'd been a girlie
Just like my dear papa.

Mounties: He cuts down trees, he wears high heels
          Suspenders and a .... a Bra????
          (mounties break off song, and begin insulting lumberjack)

Girl: I thought you were so rugged!
