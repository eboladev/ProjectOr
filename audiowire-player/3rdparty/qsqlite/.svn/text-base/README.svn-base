This is the qsqlite plugin from the Qt SDK.  It's built statically on Windows
and linked with libclementine.  This is so librarybackend.cpp can use QLibrary
to load the symbols from sqlite (like sqlite3_create_function) which by
default aren't exported from the .dll on windows.

See the individual files for licensing information.
